*TASK DISCRIPITION*
The task involves developing a Java program that performs fundamental file operations:
Create: Generate a new text file or overwrite an existing one.
Write: Insert initial content into the file.
Read: Retrieve and display the content of the file.
Modify: Append additional content to the existing file.
These operations are essential for applications that require persistent data storage, such as logging systems, configuration management, and data processing tools.
 TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED
     1.Java Programming Language: Java is a widely-used, object-oriented programming language known for its portability across platforms. It provides robust 
       libraries for file handling, making it suitable for tasks involving file I/O operations.
    2.Visual Studio Code (VS Code):VS Code is a lightweight, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft.It supports multiple programming languages and offers a 
     rich ecosystem of extensions.
    3.Java Extension pack for VS Code:This extension pack includes essential tools for java development,such as the language support for Java(TM) by red hat, 
     debugger for Java and maven for Java. It enhances the development experience by providing features like intellisense, debugging support.
    4.Java Development Kit9jdk):The JDK is a software development kit used to develop Java applications.

PLATFORM
    Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Visual Studio Code, enhanced with the Java Extension Pack, provides a streamlined environment for Java development.

  Applicability and Use Cases
    This Java program serves as a foundational example for various real-world applications:
       1.Configuration Management: Many applications store configuration settings in text files. This program demonstrates how to create, read, and modify such 
            configuration files, enabling dynamic application behavior.
       2. logging system:logging is  curical for monitoring and debugging  application.the 
             program can be extended to log event and error to a text file,facilitating easier 
             troubleshooting and  performance monitoring
       3.Data Processing Tools:Applications that process data pften need to read from and write to files.This program proviedes a template for handling input and output operations,such as reading data from a file,processing it, and saving the results.
       4.Educational Purposes: For beginners learning Java, understanding file I/O operations is essential.
